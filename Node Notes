Node notes

Install node from website


browser: window
node: global

browser: document
node: process

v8, used in node and chrome

non-blocking I/O (input output)...database read write...changing files on file system...making http request to another web server
syncronous vs asyncronous

Node is single threaded, but, it is non-blocking so it's not a problem, huge open source ecosystem
Multi-threaded applications could fire off at the same time, but it would require better cpu power and better ram (to create new threads), and doesn't scale as easily
